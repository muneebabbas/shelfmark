# Context

A glossary of the canonical terms in the Shelfmark fork's library effort. Devoid of implementation detail — for schema, see the tickets under `.scratch/library/`; for decisions, see `docs/adr/`.

## Book

A **Book** is a metadata-provider-backed work — an instance of "this work exists in provider X with provider id Y". A Book is **not** a release and **not** a file on disk; it is the catalog identity. The `(metadata_provider, provider_book_id)` pair is the natural key (both NOT NULL); the same work added via two providers lives as two Book rows (cross-provider merge is out of scope for the library effort).

A Book row is a **denormalized snapshot** of the provider's `BookMetadata` at add-time: title, author (primary), subtitle, publish_year, isbn_13, cover_url, series_name, series_position, language are copied into columns. The row is self-sufficient — reading book detail or the bookshelf never calls the provider. The complete raw provider payload is preserved in `metadata_json` for fields not promoted to columns (including the full ordered `authors` list). Staleness is accepted; refresh is a deferred explicit action, not a read-time behaviour. `books.updated_at` bumps on metadata refresh only — cover re-fetches (if they ever exist) don't touch it.

## Library

A user's **Library** is the set of Book rows that user has chosen to track — a per-user link onto Books (`user_library`, PK `(user_id, book_id)`, both FKs `ON DELETE CASCADE`). Library membership is orthogonal to files on disk: a Book can be in a user's Library with zero files anywhere (wishlist semantics). Removing a Book from a Library is a hard `DELETE` of the link row — no `removed_at`, no tombstone. Future "restore removed" UX is a fresh ticket that would introduce soft-delete then.

## Library Capability

A user's **Library Capability** is the administrator-assigned access level for the library workflow. A **download-capable user** may search releases and queue Downloads. A **request-only user** may add Books to their Library and submit book-level Requests, but cannot search or select releases. Admin status is a separate privilege that permits administrative operations and does not form a third Library Capability.

## Request

A **Request** is a request-only user's explicit signal that one Book in their Library has no completed Files available. It belongs to the requester and the canonical Book; adding a Book with completed Files creates no Request. A Request is `pending`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`, or `cancelled`; `fulfilled` means Files are available, not that an admin has selected a release. One selected release fulfils all still-pending Requests for that same Book and links its Files to each requester when the Download finalizes. Any path that makes Files available fulfils the pending Requests for that Book. A pending Request may be cancelled without affecting a shared Download.

## File / Download

A **File** is a concrete downloaded artifact — one `download_history` row with its own `download_path`, `format`, and `size`. Files are global (per-instance, not per-user); the Library merely surfaces them. Adding to the Library never creates a File; downloading never creates a Library entry.

A single download activity (one qbittorrent/usenet job) may produce **multiple Files**. Files belonging to the same download activity **share a `task_id`** — together they form one **release** (the post-download artefact; distinct from a "release" in the search-results sense, which is a row the user picked from). `download_history.task_id` is therefore non-UNIQUE; the release is the derived `GROUP BY task_id` across file rows. At queue time, one `'active'` sentinel row per `task_id` (per-file columns NULL) stands in for the in-flight release; at finalize, the sentinel is deleted and replaced by N concrete file rows.

`download_history.book_id` (nullable, `ON DELETE SET NULL`) links a File to a Book. Legacy / direct-mode / un-lined rows have `book_id IS NULL` and are invisible to library queries. Backfill strategy for existing rows is deferred to the implementation ticket.

A user's library surfaces a File via the **`user_downloads(user_id, history_id)` link table** — the load-bearing column for file visibility in a user's library. Multiple users can link the same `download_history` row. Unlinking a release from a user's library is a hard `DELETE` of the `user_downloads` links for **every file row in the release** (looked up by `task_id`) — releases are unlinked atomically. The File and its `download_history` row are untouched. Library file serving gates on `user_library` Book-membership (any user with the Book in their library can download any of its files), not on `download_history.user_id`. The `download_history.user_id` column stays as an audit field for "the auth identity who triggered the download" — not exposed via the library API.

`user_downloads` links are created at **finalize time** (when N file rows are concrete), not at queue time: one row per File for each Download recipient. A direct Download has its triggering user as the recipient; a shared Request fulfilment has every requester with a fulfilled Request for the Book. An in-flight release has no `user_downloads` links yet; unlinking mid-flight returns 404 (nothing linked yet).

## Orphan

An **Orphan** is a `download_history` row (a File) with zero `user_downloads` entries across all users AND not currently in-flight (`final_status != 'active'`). Orphans are admin-cleanup candidates; the cleanup mechanism (schedule, retention window, what deletes — file only vs file + row) is deferred and parked on the map's Not yet specified.

## Author

The **primary author** is a denormalized `books.author TEXT` column (one string). The full ordered author list lives in `metadata_json.authors`. There is **no `authors` table** — author identity is provider-specific (Hardcover numeric ids, Open Library `/authors/OL*` keys, Google Books none), so an instance-local author table would buy a join without buying cross-provider identity. A future authors table is parked in fog for the author-browse ticket to revisit if it demands an instance-local author route.

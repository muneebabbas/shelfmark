# WireGuard transparent egress for Shelfmark.
#
# Mirrors the structure of tor.sh: it is invoked from entrypoint.sh when
# USING_WIREGUARD=true, brings up a WireGuard tunnel, installs a strict
# kill-switch (all non-LAN egress must leave via the tunnel or be dropped),
# and supervises the tunnel with a handshake-based healthcheck.
#
# Required:
#   - container started as root with cap NET_ADMIN (and NET_RAW)
#   - a WireGuard config mounted at $WIREGUARD_CONFIG (default /config/wg0.conf)
#
# Optional env:
#   WIREGUARD_CONFIG   path to the wg-quick config     (default /config/wg0.conf)
#   WIREGUARD_INTERFACE  interface name                (default wg0)
#   LAN_NETWORK        comma-separated CIDRs kept off the tunnel so the WebUI /
#                      internal download clients (Prowlarr, qBittorrent) stay
#                      reachable, e.g. "172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8"
#   WIREGUARD_ENFORCE_DNS  when true (default), force /etc/resolv.conf so DNS
#                      lookups use a defined resolver instead of the container's
#                      inherited one. The resolver used is WIREGUARD_DNS if set,
#                      otherwise the tunnel config's own DNS = line.
#   WIREGUARD_DNS      optional explicit resolver(s) (comma/space separated) to
#                      write into /etc/resolv.conf when WIREGUARD_ENFORCE_DNS is
#                      true. Use this when the VPN provider's push DNS filters
#                      domains you need (e.g. Proton NetShield NXDOMAINs
#                      annas-archive.org). Point it at an on-LAN encrypted
#                      resolver (kept reachable via LAN_NETWORK) so queries stay
#                      private while book-source domains still resolve. When this
#                      is a LAN resolver, the DNS query leaves over the LAN and
#                      the resolver's own upstream encryption applies; the actual
#                      download still egresses through the tunnel.
#   WIREGUARD_DISABLE_IPV6  when true (default), strip IPv6 Address/AllowedIPs/DNS
#                      from the config before wg-quick. Containers frequently lack
#                      the ip6tables 'raw' table wg-quick needs, and IPv6 egress
#                      would be an additional leak surface. Set false only if the
#                      host exposes ip6tables and you explicitly want IPv6.
#   WIREGUARD_ALLOW_WEBUI_OFFTUNNEL  when false (default), the kill-switch is
#                      strictly fail-closed: the only off-tunnel egress is
#                      loopback, the tunnel device and the LAN allowlist. Set true
#                      ONLY if a NON-LAN client (e.g. a public reverse proxy on a
#                      different segment) must reach the WebUI; it permits
#                      app-server REPLY packets (--sport FLASK_PORT, conntrack
#                      REPLY) to leave off-tunnel. This is server replies only,
#                      never client-initiated egress, so it cannot leak outbound
#                      browsing/downloads or the real IP for outbound requests —
#                      but it is still an off-tunnel path while the tunnel is down,
#                      hence opt-in. LAN WebUI clients never need it (covered by
#                      LAN_NETWORK).

# Allow the encrypted WireGuard handshake/data out to each peer endpoint.
#
# We pin the allow rule to the resolved endpoint destination IP *and* UDP port
# (not the port alone). Allowing any UDP to that port would leave an off-tunnel
# egress hole for arbitrary UDP to that destination port during tunnel
# downtime/bounces (when the fwmark routes may be gone) — weakening the
# fail-closed guarantee. Pinning the destination IP closes that hole: the only
# off-NIC traffic this permits is the encrypted WireGuard transport to the peer
# itself. Endpoints are read from the LIVE interface, so they are always
# concrete resolved IPs. If the provider rotates the endpoint IP, the tunnel
# goes stale and the healthcheck bounce re-derives the new live endpoint and
# re-opens the corresponding IP+port rule (see refresh_endpoint_rules), so a
# rotation self-heals on recovery without ever leaving a wildcard-port hole.
# Rules are de-duplicated by IP+port; this function is idempotent and
# re-runnable after a bounce.
# Endpoint allow rules live in their OWN chain (SHELFMARK_WG_EP) that is
# FLUSHED and repopulated from the live interface on every call. This is the
# key difference from a plain `-A OUTPUT` approach: if the VPN provider rotates
# the peer endpoint IP/port, the stale allow rule for the OLD endpoint would
# otherwise persist forever (an off-tunnel UDP hole to a no-longer-used dest)
# and the OUTPUT chain would grow unbounded across rotations. By flushing the
# dedicated chain each sync, ONLY the current live endpoint(s) are ever
# permitted, so the "only WireGuard transport to the current peer may leave
# off-tunnel" guarantee holds and the ruleset stays bounded. The OUTPUT jump to
# the chain is installed once (idempotent via -C) ahead of the trailing DROP.

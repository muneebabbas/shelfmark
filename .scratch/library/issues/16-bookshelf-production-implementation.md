# Implement the validated bookshelf UI

## Question

Promote the validated contract from [Bookshelf / library view UI](10-bookshelf-ui.md) into production-quality code on a new feature branch. Do not merge or polish the prototype branch directly.

Use `library/10-bookshelf-prototype` at `c0540e1` as the visual and interaction reference, then reimplement it against the live `GET /api/library/books` contract from #04/#06 and the nested `/library` route from #07.

Production work includes:

- A responsive cover-forward grid with provider cover art, title, primary author, and compact global-format badges.
- A neutral title-initial fallback for books without a cover.
- Client-side title/author search and `All / Has files / Needs files` filters over the unpaginated result set.
- Navigation from a book card to `/library/:bookId`.
- A `Find this book` affordance for file-less books that opens that book detail route with Find Releases open.
- Loading, empty, and request-error states using the application's existing patterns.

The activity sidebar must remain available on this route per #07. Do not add pagination, server-side structured filtering, or a new component dependency.

Verification: `make checks` passes; the page renders against seeded/live library data; title/author search and each file-state filter work; card navigation and `Find this book` route correctly.
